            <p>See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you.

                If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. This is unplanned it really just happens. Don't be bashful drop me a line.

                Everybody needs a friend. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. You can spend all day playing with mountains.

                You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. We have a fantastic little sky! That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. That easy.

                We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.

                Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.

                How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let all these things just sort of happen.
